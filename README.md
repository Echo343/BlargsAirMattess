# BlargsAirMattress
Sleeping Bag Mod for Minecraft

This mod is a mod under the Blarg's Workshop suite. (Minecraft forum page coming later).

At the moment, all you need to know is this is a sleeping bag mod for minecraft (currently 1.7.10).  You can craft an air mattress, place it in the world like a bed, sleep, and have no fear of having your spawn point moved to the location of the air mattress.  This means you can break the air mattress after use and take it with you on your travels.

Tested on:<br/>
Minecraft v1.7.10<br/>
Forge 1.7.10-10.13.4.1456

I suspect it will work on later versions of 1.7.10, if not, write a bug up.<br/>
Feature suggestions, write a bug for those as well. (However, I probably won't be adding features any time soon.)

For those wondering, I'm not planning on converting this to 1.8 or higher any time soon.  I currently play on a personal 7.10 server and have no need or immediate desire to make a 1.8+ version (sorry!).  If, however, someone wants to create a pull request with the 1.8+ version, I'll will be happy to help merge and test it in my free time.  In the meantime, my efforts are going into other Blarg's Workshop mods (Stay Tuned!)

Oh! One more thing... Please, please, please feel free to use this in mod packs!  My mods are for anyone and everyone to use and learn from!  In fact, if you are learning how to mod.  This is good starter one to check out.  And if you want help understanding the code, feel free to send me a PM.  I would love to help!
